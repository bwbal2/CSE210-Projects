And |my |father |dwelt |in |a |tent.
For |as |the |body |without |the |spirit |is |dead, |so |faith |without |works |is |dead |also.
And |it |came |to |pass |in |those |days, |that |there |went |out |a |decree |from |CÃ¦sar |Augustus, |that |all |the |world |should |be |taxed.
And |now, |my |beloved, |how |is |it |possible |that |these, |after |having |rejected |the |sure |foundation, |can |aever |build |upon |it, |that |it |may |become |the |head |of |their |corner? |Behold, |my |beloved |brethren, |I |will |unfold |this |mystery |unto |you; |if |I |do |not, |by |any |means, |get |shaken |from |my |firmness |in |the |Spirit, |and |stumble |because |of |my |over |anxiety |for |you.
